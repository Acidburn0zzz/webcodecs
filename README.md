# WebCodecs

The [WebCodecs API](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/) allows web applications
to encode and decode audio and video.

Many Web APIs use media codecs internally to support APIs for particular uses:
- HTMLMediaElement and Media Source Extensions
- WebAudio (decodeAudioData)
- MediaRecorder
- WebRTC

But thereâ€™s no general way to flexibly configure and use these media codecs. 
Because of this, many web applications have resorted to implementing 
media codecs in JavaScript or WebAssembly, despite the disadvantages:
- Increased bandwidth to download codecs already in the browser.
- Reduced performance
- Reduced power efficiency 

It's great for:
- Live streaming
- Cloud gaming
- Media file editing and transcoding

See the [explainer](https://github.com/w3c/webcodecs/blob/main/explainer.md) for more info.
